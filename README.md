## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

You'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer or use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

```
node@v10.16.0 or higher
npm@6.9.0 or higher
git@2.17.1 or higher
```
### Docker Commands

```
1) BUILD IMAGE : docker build -t developerfolio:latest .
2) RUN IMAGE: docker run -t -p 3000:3000 developerfolio:latest
```


## How To Use 

From your command line, clone and run this mobile developer portfolio:

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/ameerhamzabeliever/Mobile-Developer-Portfolio.git

# Go into the repository
cd Mobile-Developer-Portfolio

# Setup default environment variables
# For Linux
cp env.example .env
# For Windows
copy env.example .env

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start a local dev server
npm start
```

## Linking Portfolio to GitHub

Generate a classic GitHub personal access token following these [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic) (make sure you don't select any scope just generate a simple token). If you are using [GitHub Actions](#configuring-github-actions-recommended) to deploy your portfolio you can skip this section.

1. Create a file called .env in the root directory of your project (if not done already in section: [How To Use](#how-to-use))

Note: Configuring environment variables before deploying your portfolio is highly recommended as some components depend on API data. 

```bash
- Mobile-Developer-Portfolio
  - node_modules
  - public
  - src
  - .env         <-- create it here
  - env.example  <-- this is the base file
  - .gitignore
  - package-lock.json
  - package.json
```

2. Inside the .env file, add key `REACT_APP_GITHUB_TOKEN` and assign your GitHub token like this, also add your username as `GITHUB_USERNAME`

```env
// .env
REACT_APP_GITHUB_TOKEN = "YOUR GITHUB TOKEN HERE"
GITHUB_USERNAME = "ameerhamzabeliever"
USE_GITHUB_DATA = "true"
```

Set `showGithubProfile` to true or false to show Contact Profile using GitHub, defaults to false.

**Warning:** Treat your tokens like passwords and keep them secret. When working with the API, use tokens as environment variables instead of hardcoding them into your programs.

Note: Open Source Projects section only show pinned items of your GitHub.
If you are seeing something as shown below, follow these [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.13/user/articles/pinning-items-to-your-profile).

![ERROR](https://i.imgur.com/Hj6mu1K.png)

If the above solution still doesn't work, visit the [wiki page](https://github.com/saadpasta/developerFolio/wiki/Github-Setup-For-Open-Source-Projects).

## Linking blogs section to Medium

Optionally, you can link the blogs section to your medium user account:

* Inside the .env file, add key `MEDIUM_USERNAME` and assign your Medium username

```env
// .env
MEDIUM_USERNAME = "YOUR MEDIUM USERNAME"
```

* For Github Action, change the environment variable `MEDIUM_USERNAME` in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

Set `displayMediumBlogs` to true or false in portofolio.js to display fetched Medium blogs, defaults to true.

## Customization Guide

**Configuration in `portfolio.js`:**
```javascript
const achievementSection = {
  title: emoji("Achievements And Certifications üèÜ "),
  subtitle: "Achievements, Certifications, Award Letters and Some Cool Stuff that I have done !",
  achievementsCards: [
    {
      title: "achievements.cards.apple.title", // Localization key
      subtitle: "achievements.cards.apple.subtitle", // Localization key
      image: require("./assets/images/appleCertificate.png"),
      imageAlt: "Apple iOS Development Certificate"
    },
    {
      title: "achievements.cards.hackathon.title",
      subtitle: "achievements.cards.hackathon.subtitle", 
      image: require("./assets/images/HackathonCertificate.png"),
      imageAlt: "Hackathon Winner Certificate"
    },
    {
      title: "achievements.cards.speaker.title",
      subtitle: "achievements.cards.speaker.subtitle",
      image: require("./assets/images/leaderCertificate.jpg"),
      imageAlt: "Leadership and Speaking Certificate"
    }
  ],
  display: true
};
```

**Implementation Details:**
- **Images**: 280px height on desktop, 250px on tablet, 220px on mobile
- **Cards**: Minimum 500px height with flexible content area

#### Using Emojis

For adding emoji üòÉ into the texts in `Portfolio.js`, use the `emoji()` function and pass the text you need as an argument. This would help in keeping emojis compatible across different browsers and platforms.

#### Customize Lottie Animations

You can choose a Lottie and download it in json format from sites like [this](https://lottiefiles.com/). In `src/assets/lottie`, replace the Lottie json file you want to alter with the same file name. If you want to change the Lottie options, go to `src/components/displayLottie/DisplayLottie.js` and change the `defaultOptions` object, you can refer [lottie-react docs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lottie-react) for more info on the `defaultOptions` object.

## Deployment
When you are done with the setup, you should host your website online.
We highly recommend to read through the [Deploying on GitHub Pages](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages) docs for React.

#### Configuring GitHub Actions (Recommended)
First you should enable, GitHub Actions for the repository you use.

The Profile and the Repository information from GitHub is only created at the time of deploy and the site needs to be redeployed if those information needs to be updated. So, a configurable [CRON Job](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#scheduled-events) is setup which deploys your site every week, so that once you update your profile on GitHub it is shown on your portfolio. You can also trigger it manually using `workflow_dispatch` event, see [this guide](https://github.blog/changelog/2020-07-06-github-actions-manual-triggers-with-workflow_dispatch) on how to do that.

- When you are done with the configuration, we highly recommend to read through the [GitHub Actions Configuring a workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/configuring-a-workflow) docs.

#### Deploying to GitHub Pages

This section guides you to deploy your mobile developer portfolio on GitHub pages.

- Navigate to `package.json` and enter your domain name instead of the default homepage in `homepage` variable. For example, if you want your site to be `https://<your-username>.github.io/Mobile-Developer-Portfolio`, add the same to the homepage section of `package.json`.

- You can also add `/Mobile-Developer-Portfolio` to `package.json`. Upon doing so, you tell `create-react-app` to add the path assets accordingly.

- Optionally, configure a custom domain. You can configure a custom domain with GitHub Pages by adding a `CNAME` file to the `public/` folder.

- Follow through the guide to setup GitHub pages from the official CRA docs [here](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages).

#### Deploying to Netlify

You can also host your mobile developer portfolio directly with Netlify by linking your own repository.

For more information, read [hosting on Netlify](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#netlify).
